# Siefer-DnD4e-fg-race-extension

The beginnings of a DnD 4e extension for Fantasy Grounds that adds various capabilities from other rulesets that I want to see in the 4e one. This mostly includes creating other records and making them draggable onto the character sheet.

#Release Notes  
v.0.1.0 - 04/13/2025 - Initial Release  
v.0.2.0 - 06/05/2025 - Added new tabs to the race library records. The second one is traits, with some fields, and ways to add more custom ones, and the third tab is for race-specific mechanical features and powers. They should be able to be dragged to the character sheet to add the features to the abilities tab and the powers to the powers tab.  
v.0.3.0 - 06/09/2025 - Added speed to character when race is drag-and-dropped on character main sheet.  
v.0.4.0 - 06/09/2025 - Added special movement, senses/vision, and languages to race information that is added when a race is drag-and-dropped on a character main sheet.  
v.0.5.0 - 06/11/2025 - Added skills and ability score bonuses to race information that is added when a race is drag-and-dropped on a character sheet. Skills are replaced when another race is added, ability score bonuses are not. If the race gives a choice between multiple ability scores, a dialogue box appears where you can select the one you want.  
v.0.6.0 - 06/17/2025 - Race bonuses should be able to parse better from description text, making it work better with older versions of the compendium module. Powers, features, etc are also no longer added when they already exist on the character. Racial ability score bonuses are reset when adding a new race.
